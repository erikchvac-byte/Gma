# Deferred Work

## Deferred from: code review of 2-1-age-gate (2026-06-10)

- No cross-tab/multi-instance localStorage sync in `useLocalStorage` (no `storage` event listener / `useSyncExternalStore`) — two tabs or two consumers of the same key diverge until reload. Out of MVP scope; worst case the age gate stays up in a second tab.
- `setValue` lacks a functional-update form (`setValue(prev => ...)`), so future read-modify-write consumers risk stale closures; `T` including `undefined` serializes to the literal string `"undefined"`. No current consumer affected.
- `useLocalStorage` ignores `key` prop changes after mount (value read once in the lazy initializer). No consumer changes keys today.
